      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>But the administration’s attempts to bestride events seem hollow.  What appears to be happening is that everything in the Middle east is the same as it always was, only more so, and in a way that has shredded the diplomatic green baize routine.  None of the hatreds, fault lines, corruption, ethnic divisions, schisms and vendettas of the region have been resolved; only now they are in the open and clamoring in the street, fueled by Google, Facebook and Twitter. The policy of kicking the can down the road has suddenly stopped working. All the problems which diplomats thought they had decades to solve are now simultaneously coming to the table, urgent, immediate and uncompromising.</p>
<p>In decades past the West could impose a kind of queue on the incoming threads and marshal resources for their orderly resolution.  The current crisis threatens to blow past the elaborately constructed edifices of the EU, UN, IMF and group of industrialized countries the way German Panzers blasted past the Maginot Line. What may be failing, in addition to the authoritarian regimes of the Middle East and Southwest Asia, is the entire International System.</p>
<p>After the shock and euphoria of change fade next few months, the resolution of the problems which have been so abundantly thrown up will come down to the primitive things: supplies of energy, food, logistics, information and military force.  It would be ironic indeed if the 21st century ushered in, not the suave, international order that Eurocrats predicted, but a Hobbesian world in which the new rules have yet to be determined.</p></blockquote>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Does the collective wisdom of the Web really say that Penney has the most essential site when it comes to dresses? And bedding? And area rugs? And dozens of other words and phrases?<p>The New York Times asked an expert in online search, Doug Pierce of Blue Fountain Media in New York, to study this question, as well as Penney’s astoundingly strong search-term performance in recent months. What he found suggests that the digital age’s most mundane act, the Google search, often represents layer upon layer of intrigue. And the intrigue starts in the sprawling, subterranean world of “black hat” optimization, the dark art of raising the profile of a Web site with methods that Google considers tantamount to cheating.</p><p>Despite the cowboy outlaw connotations, black-hat services are not illegal, but trafficking in them risks the wrath of Google. The company draws a pretty thick line between techniques it considers deceptive and “white hat” approaches, which are offered by hundreds of consulting firms and are legitimate ways to increase a site’s visibility. Penney’s results were derived from methods on the wrong side of that line, says Mr. Pierce. He described the optimization as the most ambitious attempt to game Google’s search results that he has ever seen.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A little while ago, I decided that I wanted to be more flexible with where I was working, so I started slimming down the files I was keeping and started moving all of my data into the cloud.</p>
<p>This weekend I finally completed that task and all of my work files that I use are now synched up using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. I still have 2/3&#8217;s of my space available - but have thrown out a TON of files that I was keeping for no good reason at all.</p>
<p>All of my email is forwarded to a single <a href="http://gmail.com/">Gmail</a> account. A Google Calendar manages where I need to be and when.</p>
<p>All of my notes / todo lists / etc. are synched up with <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a> - I&#8217;m using <a href="http://selfcoded.com/app/justnotes/">JustNotes</a> on my desktop when I don&#8217;t want to use the web interface.</p>
<p>All of my website passwords and synched using <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword">1Password</a> to all the computers I use.</p>
<p>All of my code is in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>Everything is backed up - for the first time in my life all my important files on all of my computers is backed up one way or another - Time Machine or Dropbox&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/features">unlimited undo</a>.</p>
<p>Feels nice to have my digital life all squared away at the moment - we&#8217;ll see how this works out and if the increased flexibility is of any use at all.</p>
