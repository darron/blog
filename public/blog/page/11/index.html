  <div class="entry-content"><p>A little while ago, I decided that I wanted to be more flexible with where I was working, so I started slimming down the files I was keeping and started moving all of my data into the cloud.</p>
<p>This weekend I finally completed that task and all of my work files that I use are now synched up using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. I still have 2/3&#8217;s of my space available - but have thrown out a TON of files that I was keeping for no good reason at all.</p>
<p>All of my email is forwarded to a single <a href="http://gmail.com/">Gmail</a> account. A Google Calendar manages where I need to be and when.</p>
<p>All of my notes / todo lists / etc. are synched up with <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a> - I&#8217;m using <a href="http://selfcoded.com/app/justnotes/">JustNotes</a> on my desktop when I don&#8217;t want to use the web interface.</p>
<p>All of my website passwords and synched using <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword">1Password</a> to all the computers I use.</p>
<p>All of my code is in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>Everything is backed up - for the first time in my life all my important files on all of my computers is backed up one way or another - Time Machine or Dropbox&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/features">unlimited undo</a>.</p>
<p>Feels nice to have my digital life all squared away at the moment - we&#8217;ll see how this works out and if the increased flexibility is of any use at all.</p>

There’s zero chance of Egypt’s uprising turning into the 1979 Iranian revolution or the terrorist violence of Hamas; there are no parties, and no Egyptian constituency of any size, seeking a theocracy.</blockquote>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">After three decades of Mubarak rule, a window of opportunity has opened for various political forces — from the moderate to the extreme — that preferred to keep the spotlight on the liberal face of the demonstrations while they maneuver from behind. As the <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20110126-intelligence-guidance-situation-egypt">Iranian Revolution of 1979</a> taught, the ideology and composition of protesters can wind up having very little to do with the political forces that end up in power. Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood (MB) understands well the concerns the United States, Israel and others share over a political vacuum in Cairo being filled by Islamists. The MB so far is proceeding cautiously, taking care to help sustain the demonstrations by relying on the MB’s well-established social services to provide food and aid to the protesters. It simultaneously is calling for elections that would politically enable the MB. With Egypt in a state of crisis and the armed forces stepping in to manage that crisis, however, elections are nowhere near assured. What is now in question is what groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and others are considering should they fear that their historic opportunity could be slipping.</blockquote>
