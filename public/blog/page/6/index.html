      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Having Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s downgrade the creditworthiness of the U.S., and warn the country about further downgrades, is a little like having the Catholic Church lecture Scout leaders on the proper behavior toward boys. The moral authority seems to be wanting. S&amp;P, you may recall, is one of the ratings agencies (the others being Moody&#8217;s and Fitch) that greased the skids of the financial crisis by awarding AAA ratings to tranche after tranche of mortgage bonds called collaterized debt obligations, or CDOs. Recall that, unlike U.S. Treasuries, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S., CDOs were underwritten by garbage mortgages — that is, backed by no-documentation “liar loans” and other Alt-A subprime pond scum handed to borrowers who otherwise couldn&#8217;t get a nickel&#8217;s worth of credit at their local dry cleaner.</p>
<p>S&amp;P stamped CDOs with the same grade it previously awarded to a precious few companies, including Exxon and Microsoft. More than 30,000 CDOs got the AAA blessing from the agencies. S&amp;P couldn&#8217;t pull its snout out of the trough even when it became apparent in 2007 that the mortgage bond pig-out was over. This e-mail from an S&amp;P employee, uncovered by a congressional investigation, says it all: “Let&#8217;s hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters.” In their absorbing history of the financial crisis, <em>The Devils Are All Here</em>, Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera bared the behavior of the agencies. Even when their own analysts began sounding the alarm, senior management refused to stop the money machine. And if the analysts became insistent on being scrupulous, the agencies got new analysts. Why? Because their clients, big banks such as Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs, demanded that the CDO machine keep on cranking, until it utterly collapsed.</p></blockquote>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Jason’s main point is Canada bit the fiscal bullet in the mid-1990s and so has been in a better position to weather the current economic storm. While much remains to be done to bring taxes and government spending down, by reducing spending 16 years ago (and not ramping it up outrageously since), we are coming out of the recession faster than the States. And, of course, the Liberals deserve the credit for the belt-tightening of 1995 that help leave us in such a good position today.</p>
<p>“While the U.S. remains mired in debt and slogs through a subpar economic recovery,” Clemens writes, “Canada is moving ahead steadily.</p>
<p>Its unemployment rate peaked at a little over 8.5% and is now 7.4%, and there were no bank bailouts. Real GDP growth is expected to be roughly 3% this year.” In the U.S. unemployment is over 9% and the economy grew by an anaemic 1.3% on an annualized basis in the first quarter. An economy that would need to produce 250,000 jobs a month to return employment to pre-recession levels is – when it’s lucky – producing 50,000 to 60,000.</p></blockquote>
