      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>But where did all these experts get the data from? Well, NASA’s assertion that Himalayan glaciers “may disappear altogether” by 2030 rests on one footnote, citing the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report from 2007.</p>
<p>In fact, the Fourth Assessment Report suggests 2035 as the likely arrival of Armageddon, but what’s half a decade between scaremongers? They rate the likelihood of the glaciers disappearing as “very high”—i.e., more than 90 per cent. And the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for that report, so it must be kosher, right? Well, yes, its Himalayan claims rest on a 2005 World Wildlife Fund report called “An Overview of Glaciers.”</p>
<p>WWF? Aren’t they something to do with pandas and the Duke of Edinburgh? True. But they wouldn’t be saying this stuff if they hadn’t got the science nailed down, would they? The WWF report relies on an article published in the New Scientist in 1999 by Fred Pearce.</p>
<p>That’s it? One article from 12 years ago in a pop-science mag? Oh, but don’t worry, back in 1999 Fred did a quickie telephone interview with a chap called Syed Hasnain of Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. And this Syed Hasnain cove presumably knows a thing or two about glaciers.</p>
<p>Well, yes. But he now says he was just idly “speculating”; he didn’t do any research or anything like that.</p></blockquote>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Thankfully, Mr. Williams has enough money that he can fly off to wherever the best care exists. I wouldn&#8217;t resent him using the money he has earned to buy better care or faster care. I wish him a full and speedy recovery. But why don&#8217;t the rest of us have the option of escaping socialized medicine, too?</p>
<p>What I resent is the way premiers and prime ministers won&#8217;t free you or me to buy insurance that would enable us to procure first-class care in times of need. What I resent is the way many limousine liberals lash us to the mast of the good ship Medicare, then run off to the United States when it&#8217;s their lives or their families&#8217; on the line. They are like public school trustees who send their kids to private school.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care whether Mr. Williams gets treatment in St. John&#8217;s or Cleveland or Timbuktu. But then he and his fellow politicians have to stop caring where I get treatment. They have to stop limiting my health care options just to win political points.</p>
<p>In its 2005 decision in the Chaoulli case, the Supreme court ruled that if Canadian governments could not provide timely heath care they had to permit Canadians to buy insurance for private treatment, whether inside the country or out. It&#8217;s time governments lived up to that decision &#8211; so that perhaps the next time Danny Williams needs his heart fixed, he doesn&#8217;t have go to the United States.</p></blockquote>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Visiting North Korea some years ago, I was lucky to have a fairly genial &#8220;minder&#8221; whom I&#8217;ll call Mr. Chae. He guided me patiently around the ruined and starving country, explaining things away by means of a sort of denial mechanism and never seeming to lose interest in the gargantuan monuments to the world&#8217;s most hysterical and operatic leader-cult. One evening, as we tried to dine on some gristly bits of duck, he mentioned yet another reason why the day should not long be postponed when the whole peninsula was united under the beaming rule of the Dear Leader. The people of South Korea, he pointed out, were becoming mongrelized. They wedded foreigners—even black American soldiers, or so he&#8217;d heard to his evident disgust—and were losing their purity and distinction. Not for Mr. Chae the charm of the ethnic mosaic, but rather a rigid and unpolluted uniformity.</blockquote>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>If Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams urgently needed heart surgery that could not be performed in Canada, all he has to do is say so and the controversy over his decision to seek medical care in the U.S. will end.</p>

<p>    Even if Williams, a millionaire who donates his salary as premier to charity, paid for it himself, it&#8217;s hard to criticize anyone for using their own resources to seek the best medical care available.</p>

<p>    This as opposed to having the operation done in Canada, and possibly having to wait in line, simply to make a political statement in support of medicare. (Newfoundland&#8217;s medical wait times are among the longest in Canada.)</p>

<p>    Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale said Williams&#8217; surgery wasn&#8217;t available in Newfoundland, but not whether it could have been performed in Canada.</p>

<p>    Vicki Kaminksi, head of Newfoundland&#8217;s largest health authority, said Williams &#8211; who hasn&#8217;t publicly commented &#8211; acted on the recommendations of local doctors, who referred him out-of-province.</p>

<p>    But Canadian experts like pioneering heart surgeon Dr. Wilbert Keon &#8211; a Conservative senator &#8211; told the Globe and Mail there&#8217;s &#8220;no question&#8221; Williams could have chosen treatment in Canada. Alberta cardiac surgeon Dr. Arvind Koshal said Williams was setting a bad example, adding: &#8220;The optics are very poor, especially for people who are proponents of the Canadian health-care system.&#8221;</p>

<p>    Opponents of President Barack Obama&#8217;s medicare initiative in the U.S. are chortling Williams is just the latest Canadian politician to opt for U.S. health care.</p>

<p>    More significantly, our Supreme Court in 2005 &#8211; citing wealthy individuals who could bypass wait times under medicare by heading south &#8211; ruled Quebec&#8217;s law banning private medical insurance, and by implication similar laws across Canada, were unconstitutional because they denied patients the ability to seek timely care when medicare can&#8217;t provide it.</p></blockquote>
