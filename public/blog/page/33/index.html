      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Thankfully, Mr. Williams has enough money that he can fly off to wherever the best care exists. I wouldn&#8217;t resent him using the money he has earned to buy better care or faster care. I wish him a full and speedy recovery. But why don&#8217;t the rest of us have the option of escaping socialized medicine, too?</p>
<p>What I resent is the way premiers and prime ministers won&#8217;t free you or me to buy insurance that would enable us to procure first-class care in times of need. What I resent is the way many limousine liberals lash us to the mast of the good ship Medicare, then run off to the United States when it&#8217;s their lives or their families&#8217; on the line. They are like public school trustees who send their kids to private school.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care whether Mr. Williams gets treatment in St. John&#8217;s or Cleveland or Timbuktu. But then he and his fellow politicians have to stop caring where I get treatment. They have to stop limiting my health care options just to win political points.</p>
<p>In its 2005 decision in the Chaoulli case, the Supreme court ruled that if Canadian governments could not provide timely heath care they had to permit Canadians to buy insurance for private treatment, whether inside the country or out. It&#8217;s time governments lived up to that decision &#8211; so that perhaps the next time Danny Williams needs his heart fixed, he doesn&#8217;t have go to the United States.</p></blockquote>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Visiting North Korea some years ago, I was lucky to have a fairly genial &#8220;minder&#8221; whom I&#8217;ll call Mr. Chae. He guided me patiently around the ruined and starving country, explaining things away by means of a sort of denial mechanism and never seeming to lose interest in the gargantuan monuments to the world&#8217;s most hysterical and operatic leader-cult. One evening, as we tried to dine on some gristly bits of duck, he mentioned yet another reason why the day should not long be postponed when the whole peninsula was united under the beaming rule of the Dear Leader. The people of South Korea, he pointed out, were becoming mongrelized. They wedded foreigners—even black American soldiers, or so he&#8217;d heard to his evident disgust—and were losing their purity and distinction. Not for Mr. Chae the charm of the ethnic mosaic, but rather a rigid and unpolluted uniformity.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>If Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams urgently needed heart surgery that could not be performed in Canada, all he has to do is say so and the controversy over his decision to seek medical care in the U.S. will end.</p>

<p>    Even if Williams, a millionaire who donates his salary as premier to charity, paid for it himself, it&#8217;s hard to criticize anyone for using their own resources to seek the best medical care available.</p>

<p>    This as opposed to having the operation done in Canada, and possibly having to wait in line, simply to make a political statement in support of medicare. (Newfoundland&#8217;s medical wait times are among the longest in Canada.)</p>

<p>    Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale said Williams&#8217; surgery wasn&#8217;t available in Newfoundland, but not whether it could have been performed in Canada.</p>

<p>    Vicki Kaminksi, head of Newfoundland&#8217;s largest health authority, said Williams &#8211; who hasn&#8217;t publicly commented &#8211; acted on the recommendations of local doctors, who referred him out-of-province.</p>

<p>    But Canadian experts like pioneering heart surgeon Dr. Wilbert Keon &#8211; a Conservative senator &#8211; told the Globe and Mail there&#8217;s &#8220;no question&#8221; Williams could have chosen treatment in Canada. Alberta cardiac surgeon Dr. Arvind Koshal said Williams was setting a bad example, adding: &#8220;The optics are very poor, especially for people who are proponents of the Canadian health-care system.&#8221;</p>

<p>    Opponents of President Barack Obama&#8217;s medicare initiative in the U.S. are chortling Williams is just the latest Canadian politician to opt for U.S. health care.</p>

<p>    More significantly, our Supreme Court in 2005 &#8211; citing wealthy individuals who could bypass wait times under medicare by heading south &#8211; ruled Quebec&#8217;s law banning private medical insurance, and by implication similar laws across Canada, were unconstitutional because they denied patients the ability to seek timely care when medicare can&#8217;t provide it.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">Was in a meeting this afternoon with a client who was testing their site with some users. What we found out was interesting. <p /> The site was rated very positively by 95% of the visitors but they were all asking for one more thing: <p /> Engage us - give us a reason to come back because otherwise we won&#8217;t. <p /> We&#8217;ve been working with this client for a long time, and have always pushed for more dynamic sites with more timely information - we almost never have gotten that through the design phase because: <p /> &#8220;We don&#8217;t have the resources to keep it up to date.&#8221; <p /> I honestly don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a reasonable excuse for a $100M+ company. If it was a really small company with tiny budgets, sure, but not here. It&#8217;s honestly very simple: <p /> Shift a small amount of money away from a single billboard campaign, and you have another resource. <p /> Maybe do a little less online advertising, and hire somebody to keep your online presence engaging. <p /> That way, you&#8217;re not driving large amounts of people to your site, where they surf around and leave immediately because they&#8217;re not being given timely information. <p /> User happiness = timely information + engaging website. <p /> User happiness != more billboards + moar online adds that lead to a boring static site. <p /> If the point is to engage the users, then put the resources there and make it happen - there is enough $$$ somewhere, you just gotta find it. <p /> Your users are asking you to engage with them - listen.
