  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m trying to find a decent Canadian VPS provider that I can use for some of my customers.</p>
<p>Yes - I know that having your data in Canada is not really any safer than having it hosted in the USA, but I can&#8217;t fully convince some of my client&#8217;s legal departments.</p>
<p>I need:</p>
<p>1. The ability to start up additional instances without calling somebody or filling out a form so that they will &#8220;get back to me&#8221;. Ideally there would be an <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/overview.html">api</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/mobile/">iPhone app</a> or <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/">web interface</a> where I can do just that - just like I already do with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>2. Ubuntu LTS is required - CentOS or Windows only need not apply.</p>
<p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-cloud-backup-overview">Onsite backups at reasonable prices</a>. I will take care of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strongspace.com">offsite snapshots</a>&nbsp;- likely in the USA as I can&#8217;t find reasonable storage costs for 200+GB in Canada.</p>
<p>4. Reliability - I am not interested in the lowest price - I will pay more if the servers are stable.</p>
<p>5. No yearly contracts.</p>
</p>
<p>I want:</p>
<p>1. Ability to scale up those instances dynamically - <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/managing-your-server-6-resizing-your-server">just like I can currently do</a> with Rackspace Cloud.</p>
<p>2. Multiple locations in Canada would be nice.</p>
<p>3. Would be awesome if they worked with <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> or had a <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace">knife</a> <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2">plugin</a> - but not a deal breaker - I can always just <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/knife_bootstrap.html">knife bootstrap</a>&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>4. Pay by the hour resources - but will pay by the month / quarter if needed.</p>
<p>Is this too much to ask?</p>
<p>Anybody know of a company with Canadian server hardware that fits the bill?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chef workflow question&#8230;</p>
<p>Looking for a little advice here on how to move forward with some Chef built infrastructure.</p>
<p>I started going through my chef repo this Christmas - and some ugly little platform version hacks started appearing - so I got to thinking about how better to structure things - and here I am.</p>
<p>We have about 20 Rackspace Cloud Ubuntu 10.0.4 boxes running various parts of <a href="http://www.nonfiction.ca/">nonfiction&#8217;s</a> web infrastructure - they&#8217;re working great and are current with all patches, etc. I&#8217;m not likely to &#8220;dist-upgrade&#8221; them - but they&#8217;re going to be alive for a few years at least.</p>
<p>I built them with my first Chef recipes and am now wanting to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start deploying Ubuntu 12.0.4 boxes on Rackspace&#8217;s new OpenStack architecture.</li>
<li>Not break my existing infrastructure - they work great - even though the cookbooks are a little raw in places.</li>
<li>Update my chef cookbooks and use more community cookbooks with <a href="http://berkshelf.com">Berkshelf</a>, <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>, Jenkins, etc.</li>
<li>Stop using roles - which were used extensively before.</li>
</ol>
<p>These boxes are built and all installed packages and software are managed with Chef - but much of the data on them isn&#8217;t managed in Chef - clients upload their own files, etc. Between DNS that I don&#8217;t manage 100% and that customer data, it&#8217;s not super simple to just &#8220;redeploy&#8221; and rebuild everything.</p>
<p>So my plan is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an environment called &#8220;lucid&#8221;.</li>
<li>Freeze all the current cookbook versions and assign them to that environment.</li>
<li>Create a new environment called &#8220;precise&#8221;</li>
<li>Deploy new boxes using that environment.</li>
<li>Fork my own chef repo and rebuild / test with Berkshelf, Vagrant, Jenkins, etc.</li>
<li>If a Lucid box can be discarded and rebuilt with Precise - I&#8217;ll do it - but likely not all of them.</li>
</ol>
<p>What do other people do when they&#8217;re updating their infrastructure like this? New chef repo? Keep it all in one? Any tips? I&#8217;ve been looking through all sorts of links online and haven&#8217;t seen much of that sort of discussion.</p>
<p>Reading through <a href="http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2012/11/19/chef-repository-berkshelf-conversion/">this article</a> it looks like he converted his chef-repo and just kept moving - that sort of scares me a little bit - but I guess is an option.</p>
<p>Any tips / links would be appreciated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>It works like this: In order to keep <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/11/27/news/economy/farming/index.html?iid=EL">dairy farmers</a> in businesses, the government agrees to buy milk and other products if the price gets too low. The current <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/04/news/economy/farm-subsidies/index.html?iid=EL">agriculture bill</a> has a formula that  means the government steps in if the price of milk were to drop by roughly half from its current national average of about $3.65 a gallon.
                       
                   </p>    
                   <p>
                        Problem is, the current bill expired last summer, and Congress had been unable to agree on a new one. Several protections for farmers have already expired, and several more are set to do so over the next few months. One of them is the dairy subsidy, which expires January 1.
                       
                   </p>    
                   <p>
                        But instead of leaving farmers entirely out in the cold, the law states that if a new bill isn&#8217;t passed or the current one extended, the formula for calculating the price the government pays for dairy products reverts back to a 1949 statute. Under that formula, the government would be forced to buy milk at twice today&#8217;s price &#8211; driving up the cost for everyone.</p></blockquote>

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">I<span style="">ndisputably, for much </span>of American history, gun-control measures, like many other laws, were used to oppress African Americans. The South had long prohibited blacks, both slave and free, from owning guns. In the North, however, at the end of the Civil War, the Union army allowed soldiers of any color to take home their rifles. Even blacks who hadn’t served could buy guns in the North, amid the glut of firearms produced for the war. President Lincoln had promised a “new birth of freedom,” but many blacks knew that white Southerners were not going to go along easily with such a vision. As one freedman in Louisiana recalled, “I would say to every colored soldier, ‘Bring your gun home.’”</blockquote>
