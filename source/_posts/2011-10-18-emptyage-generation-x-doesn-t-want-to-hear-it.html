      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>But Generation X is tired of your sense of entitlement. Generation X also graduated during a recession. It had even shittier jobs, and actually had to pay for its own music. (At least, when music mattered most to it.)&nbsp;Generation X is used to being fucked over. It lost its meager savings in the dot-com bust. Then came George Bush, and 9/11, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Generation X bore the brunt of all that. And then came the housing crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generation X wasn’t surprised. Generation X kind of expected it.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
