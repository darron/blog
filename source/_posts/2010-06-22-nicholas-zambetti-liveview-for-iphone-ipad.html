      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>LiveView is a specialized remote screen viewing application intended as a tool to help designers create graphics for mobile applications, it has also proven to be useful for creating quick and dirty simulations, demos, and experience prototypes.</p>
					<p><strong>For visual designers —</strong> Develop pixel–perfect graphics for the iPhone and iPad quickly and easily with a live view of your canvas/artboard while you work.</p>
					<p><strong>For interaction designers —</strong> With your iPhone or iPad tethered via WiFi, you can interact with software prototypes and demos running on your Mac to communicate and iterate your concepts quickly.</p>
					<p><strong>For everyone —</strong> If you've ever needed to press a button from afar or wished that you could take a piece of your monitor with you across the room, this app may prove useful from time to time.</p></blockquote>
