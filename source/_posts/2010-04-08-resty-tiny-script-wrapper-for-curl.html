<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Resty is a tiny script wrapper for <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>. It
provides a simple, concise shell interface for interacting with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a> services.
Since it is implemented as functions in your own shell and not in its own
command environment you have access to all the powerful shell tools, such
as perl, awk, grep, sed, etc. You can use resty in pipelines to process data
from REST services, and PUT or POST the data right back.  You can even pipe
the data in and then edit it interactively in your text editor prior to PUT
or POST.</blockquote>
