      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>In the past two weeks, I have been called in for some near-emergency tuning of two rails applications that recently went into production.  One was for a state-level government agency, the other was for a startup that recently went into production and found performance problems as their app grew in popularity.  In both cases, the first place I looked was the innodb table settings for mysql - and in both cases, I found things that could immediately help the application in question.</p>

<p>I'm going to walk you through that thought process now, potentially teach you something about your own rails app, and hopefully improve the performance of your rails application.</p></blockquote>
