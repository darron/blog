      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Open government isn't about just one government. That's why I got in touch with <a href="http://eaves.ca/about/">David Eaves</a>, a public policy entrepreneur and a speaker at this week's <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/gov2-international">Gov 2.0 International online conference</a>. In the following Q&amp;A, Eaves weighs in on the state of open government in Canada. He also talks about the ironic adoption of open government <em>behind</em> firewalls, and he calls government's insistence on only releasing completed projects a "collectively imagined limitation."</blockquote>
