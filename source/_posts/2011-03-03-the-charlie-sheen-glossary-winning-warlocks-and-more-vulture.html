<em>proper noun, verb</em>, Sheened, Sheening<br />
1. the actor whose erratic behavior may have cost him his lucrative job as a sitcom lead<br />
2. the perfectly legal, yet dangerous substance that said actor claims to use recreationally, e.g., "I'm on a drug. It's called Charlie Sheen. It's not available. If you try it once, you will die"<br />
3. the act of behaving in a manner akin to this actor, as in Trey Parker and Matt Stone <a href="http://www.gotchamediablog.com/2011/03/letterman-trey-parker-and-matt-stone.html">telling</a> David Letterman that they were "Sheening pretty hard" when they cross-dressed at the Oscars</p>
