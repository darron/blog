    <p>The type of technology they're using makes no sense unless they're developing nuclear weapons.</p><p>It's only a matter of time until Israel does what they think is necessary to survive - especially since Ahmadinejad threatened to wipe them out again today.</p><p>That is not a good scenario but nobody's willing to stop them.</p><p>Hope and change hasn't helped. Russia and China won't sanction them.</p><p>Not good.</p></div>
