This Christmas, I decided that I would take on a challenge over the holidays - and I decided to confront something I previously hated:

JavaScript

I've spent the last 11 years bootstrapping and running a [corporate communications business](http://www.nonfiction/ca). This means that I haven't been able to do as much technology work as I'd have liked to. I am a sysadmin who can code - not a developer who can sysadmin - and as such - front end technology such as JavaScript was always very frustrating to me.

So I decided that I was going to take 3 JavaScript courses this season to conquer that frustration - which was mostly born out of fear.

I ended up doing all three parts of the [JavaScript Road Trip](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript) and I have to say that I enjoyed it quite a bit. I was a little frustrated when my solution wasn't accepted even though it was correct - but overall it was a great experience. \(I filed bugs with the Code School team and they were a great help.\) It wasn't as hard I had told myself it would be, and it stretched my mind and helped me feel at ease in JavaScript land.

Next up - [Ember.js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/warming-up-with-emberjs) and then [Node](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-nodejs).

I'm going to keep taking courses for the forseesable future - I'm much happier when I'm learning something.
