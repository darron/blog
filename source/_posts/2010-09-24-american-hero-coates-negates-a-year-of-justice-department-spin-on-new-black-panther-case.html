      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>I testified before the Commission in  July that Obama political appointee Julie Fernandes  made it clear that the Voting Section at the Justice Department would  not be bringing any more cases against traditional national racial  minorities, like the members of the New Black Panthers. Under oath, Coates  corroborated my testimony.</p>
<p>The public has been wondering for over  a year why the case was dismissed. Coates  testified why today:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>[There is a]  deep-seated opposition to the race-neutral enforcement of the Voting  Rights Act against racial minorities and for the protection of whites  who have been discriminated against.</p></blockquote>
