      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">It’s important to consider the less easily monetized yet real benefits from using Gobar Gas.  Saving 2,500 kilograms of trees per family each year has long-term economic value, and it keeps the birds and squirrels happy.  Improved health from better sanitation and the absence of constant wood smoke in the home has clear economic benefits, as does the ability to send children, freed from the labor of searching for fuel, to school.  These items, and many others, don’t fit on a balance sheet, but they improve conditions for real, long-term economic and social development.  Health and education are the foundations of human capital needed to sustain a wealthier, more advanced society.</blockquote>
