      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Nathan Myhrvold is an inventor and killer of mosquitos with lasers. The mosquito death ray demoed in the video below was built in-house by Myhrvoldâ€™s company <a href="http://intellectualventureslab.com/" target="_blank">Intellectual Ventures Lab</a> from parts purchased on eBay.</p><p>Every 43 seconds, a child dies from malaria. Given the constraints of current methods for fighting the disease, Myhrvold put the scientific minds of his company to the problem of eradicating the mosquitoes themselves. The lasers recognize and track the insects, measuring the frequency of the wingbeats to determine their gender. Females are targeted specifically and zapped to prevent them from taking blood meals and breeding more mosquitoes.</p></blockquote>
