    <p>I hooked up notify.io to another site last night - it's a small web app that's not really live yet, but it helps to satisfy a desire when you release something:</p><p>Is anybody actually using this? Or did I just waste a whole lot of time making it?</p><p>Oh yeah, there's always Analytics, but they're often uber-delayed and just not as fun to see live.</p><p>I'll probably turn it off shortly after launch, but it will be interesting to see if/how it gets used - this way I can keep an eye on it.</p></div>
