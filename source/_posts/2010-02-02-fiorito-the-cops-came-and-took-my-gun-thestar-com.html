      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>The last time I used it, I was walking along a hydro cut when I surprised a deer in the long dry grass. She leapt away in slow motion, flanks rippling, nostrils flaring; too beautiful. </p> 
  <p>I haven't hunted since. </p> 
  <p>I own no shells. </p> 
  <p>But it's my gun, dammit. I guess, when the Feds began the long-gun registry, I should have lied and not bothered to register the damn thing.</p> 
  <p>Officer K. pressed me about turning the gun over, there and then, for storage or destruction. For a brief moment I thought about handing it over, if only to get rid of him and his pal. </p> 
  <p>And then it just seemed wrong: </p> 
  <p>A couple of cops show up at my door, unannounced, and the talkative one says he has reason to believe, and I'm supposed to hand over my property just like that? </p></blockquote>
