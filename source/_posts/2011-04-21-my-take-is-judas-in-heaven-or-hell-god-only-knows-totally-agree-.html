      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>What is interesting to me is that in the upper room where Jesus and his disciples shared their last supper together, the 12 disciples all talked about how they were so great. Peter left the room and denied Jesus three times.&nbsp; Judas left the room and sold Jesus out for 30 coins.</p>
<p>One committed suicide, and one went on to build the church as we know it today. Both Peter and Judas committed the same sin. They both denied Jesus. But why do most people think one goes to heaven and one goes to hell?</p>
<p>This is not the debate Christians need to be engaged in. We donâ€™t know. Instead of wasting our time on these types of arguments inside our little Christian world, maybe we should look inside ourselves this Easter.</p>
<p>It is easier to debate these issues and make speculations about others than it is to actually look at ourselves in the mirror. It is always easier to think someone else is worse off then we are.</p></blockquote>
