<p>Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams is set to undergo heart surgery this week in the United States.</p>
<p>CBC News confirmed Monday that Williams, 59, left the province earlier in the day and will have surgery later in the week.</p>
<p>The premier's office provided few details, beyond confirming that he would have heart surgery and saying that it was not necessarily a routine procedure.</p>

<p>The fact that this is against the law in Canada is pure bullshit. Two tier healthcare is alive and well in Canada folks - and I'm okay with that - but:</p>
<p>1. It is currently illegal to pay for a "medically necessary" procedure. <br />2. We have a sitting Premier who appears to be doing just that.</p>
<p>Will there be any penalty for him? Or will we just hear the chorus of: "He's too important to wait for the surgery."</p>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
