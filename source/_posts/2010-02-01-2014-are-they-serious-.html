      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Google isn’t alone in dropping IE6: when Apple launched its MobileMe service it raised eyebrows by never supporting IE6 in the first place; similarly, Microsoft itself won’t be supporting IE6 in its own Office Web applications. Microsoft has been encouraging Windows users to update to IE7 and IE8, but doesn’t plan to force anyone to do anything: Microsoft officially intends to support IE6 through early 2014.</blockquote>
