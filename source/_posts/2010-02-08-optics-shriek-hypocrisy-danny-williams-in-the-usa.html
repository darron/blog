      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>So when he flew southward for heart surgery, leaving wintry St. John's behind, he had to have known what it would look like. And not given a hoot.</p><p>Here's the nub: Williams is the guy who leads the province, the jurisdiction responsible for administering the health care of its half-million citizens. And he's publicly decided it isn't good enough to serve his medical needs.</p><p>True, in the absence of details about his actual condition, it is fair to speculate that the procedure he needed is not readily available at home, either through lack of equipment or expertise. But that does not give him a pass to head to the States.</p></blockquote>
