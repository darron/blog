I got to write an article for this year's [SysAdvent](http://sysadvent.blogspot.ca/).

What is SysAdvent you ask? Let me tell you:

>One article for each day of December, ending on the 25th article.
>With the goals of of sharing, openness, and mentoring, we aim to provide great articles about systems administration topics written by fellow sysadmins

My article was about controlling some [octohost](https://github.com/octohost/octohost) [Docker](http://www.docker.io/) servers with [Serf](http://www.serfdom.io/).

The [article is here](http://sysadvent.blogspot.ca/2013/12/day-13-controlling-cluster-of-servers.html) - the source code for the article is posted [here](https://github.com/darron/sysadvent-docker).

I'm pretty happy with how it all turned out - would love to have been able to work on some Hubot/Serf integration but simply ran out of time.
