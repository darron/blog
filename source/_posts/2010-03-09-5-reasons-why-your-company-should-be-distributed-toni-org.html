      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Our company <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> is distributed, and I’m ready to sing the praises of running a business in this way. BTW, I think <em>distributed </em>(“evenly spread throughout an area”) is a better description than the more commonly used <em>virtual </em>(“nearly real or simulated to be real”) for a company that has people working from all over the place instead of a centralized office. In Automattic’s case, we currently have over 50 employees spread across <a href="http://automattic.com/map/">12 US states and 10 countries</a>.</blockquote>
