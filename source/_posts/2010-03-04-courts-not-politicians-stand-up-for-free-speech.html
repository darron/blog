      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>While our politicians may shy away from protecting freedom of speech and human rights commissions may trample it, it's encouraging that judges still appreciate its importance.</p><p>It helps that most judges are well versed in the subtleties of the law, like the part about this freedom applying to even buffoons. It's not explicitly spelled out in most legislation, which is perhaps why so many seem to miss it.</p></blockquote>
