title: Your customers are asking to be engaged by your site, give it to them.

Was in a meeting this afternoon with a client who was testing their site with some users. What we found out was interesting. <p /> The site was rated very positively by 95% of the visitors but they were all asking for one more thing: <p /> Engage us - give us a reason to come back because otherwise we won't. <p /> We've been working with this client for a long time, and have always pushed for more dynamic sites with more timely information - we almost never have gotten that through the design phase because: <p /> "We don't have the resources to keep it up to date." <p /> I honestly don't think that's a reasonable excuse for a $100M+ company. If it was a really small company with tiny budgets, sure, but not here. It's honestly very simple: <p /> Shift a small amount of money away from a single billboard campaign, and you have another resource. <p /> Maybe do a little less online advertising, and hire somebody to keep your online presence engaging. <p /> That way, you're not driving large amounts of people to your site, where they surf around and leave immediately because they're not being given timely information. <p /> User happiness = timely information + engaging website. <p /> User happiness != more billboards + moar online adds that lead to a boring static site. <p /> If the point is to engage the users, then put the resources there and make it happen - there is enough $$$ somewhere, you just gotta find it. <p /> Your users are asking you to engage with them - listen.
