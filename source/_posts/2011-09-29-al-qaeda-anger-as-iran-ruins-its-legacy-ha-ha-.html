      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>''The Iranian government has professed on the tongue of its President Ahmadinejad that it does not believe that al-Qaeda was behind 9/11 but rather, the US government,'' read the article, published under the byline Abu Suhail. ''So we may ask the question: why would Iran ascribe to such a ridiculous belief that stands in the face of all logic and evidence?''</p>

            <p>
The article demands that Mr Ahmadinejad stop his efforts to ''to discredit 9/11'' with conspiracy theories, accusing him and  his country's leaders of exploiting anti-American sentiment for political gain and engaging only in ''lip-service jihad''.</p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/alqaeda-anger-as-iran-ruins-its-legacy-20110929-1kzf1.html">smh.com.au</a></div>
