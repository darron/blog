Since we launched 6 days ago, we've been busy updating and upgrading [octohost](https://github.com/octohost/octohost) with all sorts of upgrades.

v0.5 is available now - the [Changelog is here](https://github.com/octohost/octohost/blob/master/Changelog.md) but the top 4 highlights are as follows:

1. [Docker 0.7](http://blog.docker.io/2013/11/docker-0-7-docker-now-runs-on-any-linux-distribution/) - released recently.
2. The [/usr/bin/octo cli](https://github.com/octohost/octohost/blob/master/docs/octo-cli.md) which allows for simple management of an octohost server.
3. SSH Agent forwarding is now supported by OpenSSH and sudo - very handy with `sudo /usr/bin/octo move sites old.ip.address.here`
4. Configuration of the domain name and the installation of additional keys is handled by [user-data/setup](https://github.com/octohost/octohost/blob/master/user-data-file/setup). That will still have to be handled manually if you're not using AWS.

Use our already built AMI \(ami-de72e8ee\) or [build your own with the source](https://github.com/octohost/octohost).
