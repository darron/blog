Deployed on Heroku using a custom buildpack:

[https://github.com/darron/heroku-buildpack-ruby-octopress](https://github.com/darron/heroku-buildpack-ruby-octopress)

This way the site is built when it's deployed - NOT on my laptop.

Thanks to [Jason Garber's blog post](http://jasongarber.com/blog/2012/01/10/deploying-octopress-to-heroku-with-a-custom-buildpack/).
