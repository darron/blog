      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p><b>What is unfolding after four decades of suppression is a full-blown
crisis of legitimacy.</b> Regardless of their purported ideological flavor,
the ruling Elites all relied on the same system of governance:
offer a simulacrum of public purpose to the world and the populace, and
ceaselessly pursue private confiscation of national income and resources.
</p><p>
Now, at long last, the consent and compliance of the ruled has dissolved.
</p><p>
It's certainly valid to place responsibility  on the colonial powers for leaving
 behind socially and economically crippled nations with hastily drawn borders;
but that would be leaving out the opportunities squandered for half a century
by the local Power Elites which took the reins of power from the colonial empires.
</p><p>
What could have been done in the post-colonial transition--the slow, careful
construction of legitimate, transparent institutions to channel development,
education and investment--was not done.  Instead, the concentrated control
and culture of expropriation of national assets and income streams for private
consumption and acquisition was continued. The iron fist of Empire was neatly
covered with the attractive glove of "freedom," but that freedom was elusive
and illusory.</p></blockquote>
