      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">When Arunachalam Muruganantham hit a wall in his research on creating a sanitary napkin for poor women, he decided to do what most men typically wouldn’t dream of. He wore one himself--for a whole week. Fashioning his own menstruating uterus by filling a bladder with goat’s blood, Muruganantham went about his life while wearing women’s underwear, occasionally squeezing the contraption to test out his latest iteration. It resulted in endless derision and almost destroyed his family. But no one is laughing at him anymore, as the sanitary napkin-making machine he went on to create is transforming the lives of rural women across India.</blockquote>

    <p>I love this story. Somebody sees a need, invents a ground breaking, low cost solution and has a way to live tens of thousands of people out of poverty. I hope that it catches on and he - and they - succeed.</p></div>
