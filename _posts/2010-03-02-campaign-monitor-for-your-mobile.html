      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Today we're super excited to announce a new mobile optimized version of Campaign Monitor that gives you and your clients quick access to great looking reports on any campaigns you've sent. It's fast, looks great and is available now. Just head to your account on any popular mobile device like an iPhone or Android and the mobile version will be shown by default. <strong>You don't need to install anything, because it is a web application</strong>, not a native phone application.</blockquote>
