title: Cleaning up zone files with a simple Ruby script.
published: true

<p>This highly manual process is not super fun. So I wrote a quick script to take a look at my Bind configuration files and tell me who wasn't using me any more.</p>
<p>First of all, I had to get all of the zones from my zone files - that is a simple 1 liner:</p>
<p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/316857.js?file=gistfile1.sh"></script>
</p>
<p>Then I took that file and ran it through this simple Ruby script:</p>
<p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/316856.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>
</p>
<p>Now I can remove all of the zones that I don't answer for anymore - about a third of them.</p>
