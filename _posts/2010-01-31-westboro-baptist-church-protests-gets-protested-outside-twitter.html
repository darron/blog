      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Yesterday, the <a href="http://godhatesfags.com/"><span>Westboro Baptist Church</span></a> and their subtly-named picket group, God Hates Fags, brought their dog-and-pony-show to San Francisco. That's right -- the freaky people came to freak out the freaky people.<p>

The religious group, based in Topeka, Kansas, <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2010/01/westboro_baptist_church_known.html" target="_blank">usually pickets soldiers' funerals</a>, reasoning that they died defending a gay-loving country. Thursday, they set their sights on a larger target: the headquarters of the social-media giant <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p><p>

Apparently, God hates Twitter. Would it help matters if Jesus turned 140 characters into 280 characters?</p></blockquote>
