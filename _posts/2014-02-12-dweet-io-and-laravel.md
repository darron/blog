A few days ago, I found out about [Dweet.io](http://dweet.io/) which is billed as "Ridiculously simple data sharing for the Internet of Things."

The entire concept was pretty interesting to me. I liked the simplicity of it, and how it was so transient - made for machines to talk to machines. I also liked that if a message wasn't picked up in 24 hours, then it clearly wasn't important and that message disappeared.

I have also wanted try a web framework called [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) for a little while. Laravel bills itself as "the PHP framework for web artisans" and looked like something I could work with. It has all the right and proper buzzwords and seemed capable at first glance. At [nonfiction](http://www.nonfiction.ca) we have been using mostly Ruby for our app creation for the last few years - even though our CMS is written in PHP - I wanted to use a PHP framework that was more modern than our inhouse toolset.

So I decided to re-impliment Dweet.io in Laravel - and in a few hours - under 5 in total - I did.

Overall I'm pretty happy with the result and happy that I was able to bend Laravel to my will. I have started a few projects like this where I wasn't able to actually launch - even though I spent more time than 5 hours - that's frustrating.

The result is [http://dweet-laravel.herokuapp.com/](http://dweet-laravel.herokuapp.com/) and the code is available on [Github](https://github.com/darron/dweet-laravel).

It is mostly feature complete and on parity with the public documentation on Dweet.io. It provided a small project where I could get used to at least parts of the framework, and unlike some other tools, I was able to work through it fairly quickly and without too much hassle.

If you're interseted in [Dweet](http://dweet.io/) or [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), give it a spin.

If you've got a framework you want to try out, give this type of project a shot - it's a small enough feature set that's pretty easy to bite off and accomplish.
