      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>The American Scholar article by Walt Harrington entitled <a href="http://theamericanscholar.org/dubya-and-me/" target="_blank">Dubya and Me</a> is reminder that “man is a mystery”. Harrington, whose politics were very different from Bush admired him to the point of fascination. Defending him against critics who saw the Texan as a chimp, Harrington retorted, “I didn’t vote for George W. I disagree with him on the Supreme Court, environment, abortion, the death penalty and affirmative action. So I voted against this good and decent man. It pained me to do it.”</p>
<p>No one can read Harrington’s piece without wondering whether we can know Barack Obama either.&nbsp; “In the remaining years of his presidency, I visited Bush several more times, always in the Oval Office.” Harrington wrote.&nbsp; “His only remark about Barack Obama was, as I recall it, ‘No matter who wins, when he hears what I hear every morning, it will change him.’”</p></blockquote>
