title: Jeff Loflin was talking about Sidemount Diving at The Dive Shop today

<p>I went to a presentation at <a href="http://www.diveshopscuba.com/" title="The Dive Shop Calgary">The Dive Shop</a> by visiting instructor <a href="http://www.jeffloflin.com/" title="Jeff Loflin | Technical, Sidemount, and Cave Dive Training">Jeff Loflin</a> on Cave diving and the path to Full Cave (and beyond) last night.</p>
<p>It was interesting enough to me, so I bought his <a href="http://www.sidemountvideo.com/" title="Sidemount Video">new sidemount training video</a> and watched it last night waiting for a chance to try out a sidemount rig today.</p>
<p>Today Jeff gave another 1.5 hour presentation on the changes he's seen to sidemount over the last 6 years, he traced its evolution from Europe a few decades ago, to where it is today - the <strong>new big thing</strong>&trade;.</p>
<p>After the talk, a bunch of us got a chance to try out the Hollis sidemount gear - I tried out the <a href="http://www.hollisgear.com/prodview.asp?id=121" title="Hollis Gear: SMS 100">Hollis SMS 100</a> - the "technical" level sidemount rig.</p>
<h2>What I liked and thought was interesting:</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 completely independent life-support systems.</li>
<li>12 lbs - which means I don't need any additional weight in warm water diving.</li>
<li>Full visibility of all life-support failure points.</li>
<li>Visibility of both of the pressure gauges - right in front of my face at all times. No reaching way down to unclip, plus move bottles, and bring up as high as possible.</li>
<li>Streamlining would help in restrictions and tighter wreck situations.</li>
<li>Valve drills for first two tanks would be very easy - ludicrously easy.</li>
<li>If you're travelling you don't need to bring your tanks and manifolds if you want to do more advanced diving - just use whatever tanks are available - would potentially be very handy.</li>
<li>Easy on/off of tanks in the water - no need to move around massive tanks in pairs.</li>
<li>A very versatile BC with tons of options and ways to set it up. One tank. Two tanks. Sidemount. Back mount.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I didn't totally like (mostly about sidemount, less about the Hollis rig itself):</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 completely independent life-support systems - I'm still partial to having my primary back gas manifolded at this time.</li>
<li>Having to swap regulators every 500 psi - just another thing to do.</li>
<li>Not being able to instinctively donate the reg that's in my mouth to an out-of-air diver - if I'm breathing from the left tank, then I need to donate the long hose on my right. Another thing to think about in a possible emergency.</li>
<li>There's a lot of pieces that come in front of my chest - I'm used to this from the tech diving gear, but it seemed much more tangled up.</li>
<li>Seems way less stable than my twinset - way more little pieces and flexing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of my concerns are likely because they're new and different to what I'm used to - not sure if they're all legit at this point without dropping another $1k and trying it out for a while. (Not this year.)</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Am I gonna switch over? Not likely at this point - unless I:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sold my <a href="http://www.revo-rebreathers.com/">rEvo</a> and wanted to do more Open Circuit. (Ummmmm - nope.)</li>
<li>Was doing really tight caves and restriction penetrations. (Yeah - that's still terrifying for me.)</li>
</ol>
<p>But it was interesting to see - and food for thought at least.&nbsp;</p>
