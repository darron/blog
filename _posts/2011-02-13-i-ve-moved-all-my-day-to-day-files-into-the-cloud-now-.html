title: I've moved all my day to day files into the cloud now.

<p>A little while ago, I decided that I wanted to be more flexible with where I was working, so I started slimming down the files I was keeping and started moving all of my data into the cloud.</p>
<p>This weekend I finally completed that task and all of my work files that I use are now synched up using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. I still have 2/3's of my space available - but have thrown out a TON of files that I was keeping for no good reason at all.</p>
<p>All of my email is forwarded to a single <a href="http://gmail.com/">Gmail</a> account. A Google Calendar manages where I need to be and when.</p>
<p>All of my notes / todo lists / etc. are synched up with <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a> - I'm using <a href="http://selfcoded.com/app/justnotes/">JustNotes</a> on my desktop when I don't want to use the web interface.</p>
<p>All of my website passwords and synched using <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword">1Password</a> to all the computers I use.</p>
<p>All of my code is in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>Everything is backed up - for the first time in my life all my important files on all of my computers is backed up one way or another - Time Machine or Dropbox's <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/features">unlimited undo</a>.</p>
<p>Feels nice to have my digital life all squared away at the moment - we'll see how this works out and if the increased flexibility is of any use at all.</p>
