      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">So how much sharing happens every month?  Let’s take a rough cut at the numbers:  there are an estimated 1 trillion to 1.4 trillion page views on the web per month.   I’ll  use the 1 trillion number for this analysis.   Our Tynt data shows that slightly over 2% of all page views result in content sharing via copy/paste meaning over 20 Billion sharing actions.   By comparison,  explicit sharing buttons built into many content pages result in about 400 million shares every month.    Another very common way to share data is by sharing links via Twitter.  According to TechCrunch Bit.ly shortens 2.1 billion links per month, which encompasses a significant amount of the Twitter sharing.    Add this all together and we can conclude that there are at least 22.5 billion monthly shares.</blockquote>
