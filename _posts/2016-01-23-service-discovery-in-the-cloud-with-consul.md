I had the pleasure to [present this at Scale14x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/service-discovery-cloud) in Pasadena, California.

I've embedded the slides below - hopefully I get the YouTube link shortly so that I can add that - it's got lots of extra information I didn't put on the slides.
