      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Twitter quickly <a href="http://www.tipb.com/2011/03/09/twitter-iphone-updated-dickbar-mandatory-slightly-intrusive/">updated the app</a>, and while it didn't make the bar removable, it did make it less intrusive so that it did not overlap tweets.</p><p>But for many users, the "Dickbar" became a sign of what a world in which only Twitter writes the Twitter apps could be like: one without choice, unlike the situation that has prevailed so far, in which anyone could write an app via the API. That doesn't fill them, or developers, with delight. Duane Roslands, in another response to Sarver on the mailing list, put it more pithily.</p><p>"Wow," he wrote. "'Thanks for getting so many people interested in Twitter. Now get lost.' This is appalling."</p></blockquote>
