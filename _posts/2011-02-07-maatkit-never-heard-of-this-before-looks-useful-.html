      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Maatkit tools try to make complicated tasks simpler and more reliable.&nbsp; Most of these tasks involve something like gluing together difficult commands inside MySQL.&nbsp; Most of the tools try to do something useful by default.&nbsp; Some of them are only for advanced power users who really know what they’re doing.&nbsp; All of the tools go to great lengths to be careful and safe with your data, sometimes to the point that users think there’s a bug when they’re really seeing unexpected behavior that  protects them from some obscure problem they didn’t think of.</blockquote>
