<p>I wanted to setup a simple webfinger server for myself today and there was nothing around so I wrote my own - it's really basic:</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/darron/webfinger-sinatra" target="_blank">http://github.com/darron/webfinger-sinatra</a></p>
<p>Grab it and improve - you can see it in action here:</p>
<p><a href="http://froese.org/.well-known/host-meta" target="_blank">http://froese.org/.well-known/host-meta</a></p>
<p><a href="http://webfinger.froese.org/webfinger/darron@froese.org" target="_blank">http://webfinger.froese.org/webfinger/darron@froese.org</a></p>
<p>Grab it, fork it, do whatever you want with it - let me know if there's any questions.</p>
