      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis itself, but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file. It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so that it can be easily adaptable to different applications.</blockquote>

    <p>It allows me to see in real time what is being requested from a particular server on my network - pretty helpful.</p><p>I used to use atop to do something similar, but that only works from logfiles. This is much better.</p></div>
