      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race, creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by publishing <a href="http://cattell.net/datastores/Datastores.pdf">High Performance Scalable Data Stores</a>, a nicely detailed one stop shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world into four groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and Riak.</li>
<li>Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB.</li>
<li>Record stores: BigTable, HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra.</li>
<li>Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB, Drizzle, and VoltDB.</li></ul></blockquote>
