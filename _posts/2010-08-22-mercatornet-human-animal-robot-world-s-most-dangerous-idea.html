      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Wrestling with
difficult questions is routine work for ethicists. But some are much more
difficult than others. MercatorNet’s question, “What did I believe was
presently the world’s most dangerous idea?”, falls in the former category. My
response, “The idea that there is nothing special about being human and,
therefore, humans do not deserve “special respect”, as compared with other
animals or even robots”, might seem anodyne and a “cop out”, but I’d like to
try to convince you otherwise.</blockquote>
