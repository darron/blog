Last year, after a lot of soul searching, I realized that it was time to move on from [nonfiction](http://www.nonfiction.ca/) - it was time for a change. However when you've founded and built a company over 13 years, moving on isn't so simple, so my business partner and I have been working a for the last few months to simplify and streamline my exit from day-to-day operations.

nonfiction is a great company that I'm proud to have built, they will be in my business partner's capable hands and I couldn't be prouder of the team that we built together.

As of May 31, 2014 I will no longer be a full time employee of nonfiction, however I will be sticking around for at least one month \(on contract\) to finish up a few projects and tie up some loose ends.

In July, I am looking for a new challenge - somewhere where I can learn and build new things, improve existing systems and keep my brain stretched.

I've been working a lot with [Docker](https://www.docker.io/), [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/), "the cloud" \(Amazon, Digital Ocean, Rackspace, etc\), [Packer](http://www.packer.io/), [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), [Cloud Foundry](http://www.gopivotal.com/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cf), [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) and other similar tools over the last few years - so I'm looking towards challenges that involve some of those technologies, but I'm pretty open to anything involving the web and distributed systems.

I'm also very excited about emerging technologies like [Consul](http://www.consul.io/), [Serf](http://www.serfdom.io/), [etcd](https://coreos.com/docs/distributed-configuration/getting-started-with-etcd/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) - I see lots of potential and interesting work around them.

Much of what I've worked on and experimented with is posted on [github](https://github.com/darron) - but some of my best work to date has been around [octohost](http://www.octohost.io) - nonfiction's Docker based mini-PaaS that's powering an unannounced and almost released product.

Another project I'm extremely proud of is the [Varnish based CDN](https://github.com/darron/frozen-cdn-cookbooks) that I built in early 2012. It was scaling up in production and handled 100M hits over 3 months very well, but when I found Fastly - we switched over and abandoned it. \(Pro tip: If you're not using [Fastly](http://www.fastly.com/) yet, you should.\)

My skillset allows me to create internet systems with a focus on empowering a team to build and run on top of those systems.

If you're looking for somebody like me, please [send me a note](mailto:darron@froese.org) and let's chat.
