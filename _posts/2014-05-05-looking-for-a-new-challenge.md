Last year, after a lot of soul searching, I realized that it was time to move on from [nonfiction](http://www.nonfiction.ca/) - it was time for a change. However when you've founded and built a company over 13 years, moving on isn't so simple, so my business partner and I have been working a for the last few months to simplify and streamline my day-to-day exit.

As of May 31, 2014 I will no longer be a full time employee of nonfiction, however I will be sticking around for at least one month \(on contract\) to finish up a few projects and tie up some loose ends.

In July, I am looking for a new challenge - somewhere where I can learn and build new things, improve existing things, and keep my brain stretched.

I've been working a lot with [Docker](https://www.docker.io/), [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/), "the cloud" \(Amazon, Digital Ocean, Rackspace, etc\), [Packer](http://www.packer.io/), [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), [Cloud Foundry](http://www.gopivotal.com/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cf), [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) and other similar tools over the last few years - so I'm looking towards challenges that involve some of those technologies, but I'm pretty open to anything involving the web and distributed systems.

Much of what I've worked on and experimented with is posted on [github](https://github.com/darron) - but some of my best work to date has been around [octohost](http://www.octohost.io) - our Docker based mini-PaaS that's powering an unannounced and almost released product.

Another project I'm extremely proud of is the [Varnish based CDN](https://github.com/darron/frozen-cdn-cookbooks) that I built in early 2012. It was scaling up in production and handled 100M hits over 3 months very well, but when we found Fastly - we switched over and abandoned it.

I build and run internet systems with a focus on enabling your team build and run things.

If you're looking for somebody like me, please [send me a note](mailto:darron@froese.org) and let's chat.
