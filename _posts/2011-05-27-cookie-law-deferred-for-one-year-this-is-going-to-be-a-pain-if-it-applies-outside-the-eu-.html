      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>The EU's Privacy and Communications Directive comes into force on 26 May.</p>
        <p>It requires user's consent before using cookies - the text files that help organise and store browsing information.</p>
        <p>Technically all firm must comply with the law but the UK has said that it needs more time to find a workable solution.</p>
        <p>The government said that it was looking for a "business-friendly" solution and believed in light-touch regulation.</p>
        <p>"We recognise that some website users have real concerns around online privacy but also recognise that cookies play a key role in the smooth running of the internet," said communications minister Ed Vaizey.</p>
        <p>"But it will take some time for workable technical solutions to be developed, evaluated and rolled out so we have decided that a phased in approach is right," he added.</p></blockquote>
