      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">If you are still wondering why Google is pushing so hard with its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/09/if-google-wave-is-the-future-google-buzz-is-the-present/">new product Buzz</a>, it is because it wants in on social traffic.  For many sites on the Web, social traffic coming through Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace is beginning to rival, and in some cases overtake, search traffic as the single biggest source of traffic.  This traffic comes from shared links, photos, and videos.  By <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">its own numbers</a>, 5 billion pieces of content are shared on Facebook every month.</blockquote>
