      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">In the first seconds and minutes after the quake, anyone tapping "earthquake Mountain View" (or the name of any other nearby municipality) into Google's search field found that the only hits pertaining to the new quake were ... tweets. While the Google results page included direct information feeds from the USGS and a slick Google Maps display of recent temblors, none reflected the latest event. Official USGS-confirmed data on the quake wouldn't show up until 10:20 a.m. But at 10:12 a.m., the sixth-highest search return was a rolling scroll of tweets posted "seconds ago": <em>Wow, that was an earthquake jolt in Mountain View!</em></blockquote>
