	  <p>Driven by the same translation services powering Cliqset.com, FeedProxy translates feed data from over 80 services into persistent Activity Streams compliant Atom feeds. Forget worrying about understanding proprietary feed formatting and learn a single, open standard for expressing what people are doing around the web.</p></blockquote>
