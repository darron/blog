It's with mixed emotions that I post this today.

I've really enjoyed my 2 years with [Datadog](https://twitter.com/datadoghq). I've loved working with the team, I love the product, I've learned a ton and I've made some great friendships.

But I had an opportunity drop into my lap and needed to take it.

September 6 I start at the [New York Times](https://twitter.com/NYTimes) as a Lead SRE on the Delivery Engineering team. My focus will be on monitoring and I'm really excited to put some of the things I've learned over the last 2 years into practice.

Working at the NY Times means me and my family have to relocate to NY - that's been in process for a couple of months and will likely take a couple more.

I'm super excited for the future - but I'm tremendously thankful to the team at Datadog that saw potential in me and believed that hiring a remote SRE from the Great White North was a good idea.

A huge thanks goes out to [Alexis L&ecirc;-Qu&ocirc;c](https://twitter.com/alq), [Mike Fiedler](mikefiedler) and [Amit Agarwal](https://twitter.com/amitcan) who took a risk on an unknown and helped me to grow and learn tons.

PS Since this was only finalized last week, I'm still looking for a place to stay for September and October, so if you know of a place for rent - 1 bedroom apartment with decent subway access to Manhattan - please send it my way [darron@froese.org](mailto:darron@froese.org).
