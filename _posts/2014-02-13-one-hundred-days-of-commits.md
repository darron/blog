100 days ago, I made a goal for myself to commit something to [Github](https://github.com/darron) every day.

I was feeling a little stagnant and wanted to challenge myself and make sure that I was learning every day.

100 days later, I feel like I've kept my momentum.

I've written [Chef cookbooks](https://github.com/search?q=%40darron+cookbooks), created a [Chef skeleton framework for myself](https://github.com/darron/skeleton-cookbook), built a few [websites](http://www.octohost.io), started an entire project - [octohost](https://github.com/octohost), posted to [my blog](http://blog.froese.org), learned about a whole bunch of new technologies: [Serf](http://www.serfdom.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.io/), [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), built a whole [bunch](https://github.com/octohost/octohost-cookbook) of [AMIs](https://github.com/octohost/ubuntu-12.0.4-3.8), Droplets and Rackspace Images with [Packer](http://www.packer.io/) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/), wrote an article for [Sysadvent](https://github.com/darron/sysadvent-docker), learned about [Ansible](https://github.com/octohost/octohost), built some [packages](https://github.com/darron/ubuntu-ruby-package-builder), updated some [Heroku buildpacks](https://github.com/darron/heroku-buildpack-ruby-jekyll), released a [Capistrano 3 example repo](https://github.com/darron/example-capistrano3) and lots of other things.

Always. Be. Committing.

I've been feeling pretty renewed and envigorated as I have built and learned things I didn't know before.

I love it - going to see how long I can keep this up. At the pace I'm at, it's pretty sustainable I just need to keep going - one commit at a time.

NOTE: If you're not logged into my account, [it looks like I've only got 15 days in a row](https://github.com/darron) - but lots of my commits are to private repos - I wish that would show on the graph - but that's how it is.
