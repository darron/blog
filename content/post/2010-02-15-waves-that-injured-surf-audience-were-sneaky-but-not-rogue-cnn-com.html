      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Spectators at the Mavericks Surfing Contest were standing on the beach at Princeton-by-the Sea, California, on Saturday morning when large waves knocked them down. More than 12 people were injured, according to local reports; video of one of the waves was recorded by CNN affiliate KRON of San Francisco.</p> <p>They were "sneaker waves," waves near the shore that are unexpectedly and significantly larger than others occurring at the time</p></blockquote>
