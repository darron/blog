      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Have you ever felt so close to someone that it seemed like the two of you were finishing each other’s sentences? Well, as a Valentine’s Day gift to the community, we at SeatGeek have distilled some of Cupid’s magic into a Redis-backed service for doing exactly that: <a href="http://github.com/seatgeek/soulmate">Soulmate</a> is a tool for building fast autocompleters.</p>
<p>Give it a try right now on <a href="http://seatgeek.com/">SeatGeek</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="http://antirez.com/post/autocomplete-with-redis.html">Auto Complete with Redis</a>, Soulmate uses sorted sets to build an index of partially completed words and the corresponding top matching items, and provides a simple sinatra app to query them.</p></blockquote>
