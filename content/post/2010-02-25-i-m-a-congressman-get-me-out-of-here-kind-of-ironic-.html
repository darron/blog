      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p> In his <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/2010/02%20February/Roitz%2002-24-10.pdf">prepared testimony</a>, Fred Roitz, executive vice president of contracts and chief sales officer for Xe (a.k.a. Blackwater), disclosed that his company, through its subsidiary Presidential Airways, evacuated a congressman from Niger during a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8523573.stm">recent military coup</a>.</p>
<p>That <a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2010/02/blackwater-rescue-alan-grayson-niger-coup">caught the eye</a> of <em>Mother Jones</em> reporter Daniel Schulman, who decided to figure out who, exactly, the congressman in distress was.</p>
<p>Turns out it was none other than <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/01/alan-grayson-filibluster">Rep. Alan Grayson</a>, the Florida Democrat who has made his reputation by <a href="http://current.com/items/91007251_rep-alan-grayson-on-de-funding-corrupt-defense-contractors.htm">going after military contractors</a>. Irony alert! Grayson spokesman Todd Jurkowski confirmed that Grayson was spirited out of the country on a Xe helicopter, and offered this statement to Schulman: “The flight was arranged through the State Department … The congressman did not know, and frankly did not care, who owned the plane.”</p></blockquote>
