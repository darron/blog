      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Back in July last year <a href="http://blog.boxedice.com/2009/07/25/choosing-a-non-relational-database-why-we-migrated-from-mysql-to-mongodb/">I wrote about our migration from MySQL to MongoDB</a>. We have been running <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> in production for our server monitoring service, <a href="http://www.serverdensity.com">Server Density</a>, since then – 8 months – and have learnt quite a few things about it. These are the kind of things that you only experience once you reach a certain level of usage and it is surprising how few issues we’ve had. Where a problem or bug has cropped up, it has been quickly resolved/fixed by the MongoDB dev team; so we’re very happy.</blockquote>
