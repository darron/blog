      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>I’d like to tell you that he travels with an entourage, that he’s unapproachable, that you play by his rules. But I’ve never met a celebrity so honest, so unguarded, so willing to go on the record as Mark Cuban. He’s got no agenda, he’s just being him.</p>
<p>Maybe you know him as the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, the NBA champs. Maybe you saw him on “Dancing With The Stars”. But to those paying attention, it was his huge financial victory selling Broadcast.com to Yahoo that put him on our radar…how did this happen?</p>
<p>I hate to tell you, but rich guys are smart. The self-made ones. Those who inherit tend to piss it away, they just don’t know about hard work. And that’s what it takes to make it and keep it.</p></blockquote>
