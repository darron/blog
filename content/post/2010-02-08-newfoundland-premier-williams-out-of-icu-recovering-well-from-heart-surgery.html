    <p>It should be possible for ANYBODY in Canada to use their own money to pay for a medically necessary procedure - but unless you're actually wealthy, that is pretty much impossible.</p><p>We HAVE to pay approximately 1/3 of our taxes to the government for our medical care - there is no ability to take that 1/3 and pay somebody else. When I compare 1/3 of my taxes to family in the US, they actually pay a little less than me.</p><p>Until it is an option for the rest of us, Danny Williams doesn't get a free pass by jumping every line that we're all stuck in.</p><p>I'd like to see real health care debate in this country - not the highly politicized drivel we're used to.</p></div>
