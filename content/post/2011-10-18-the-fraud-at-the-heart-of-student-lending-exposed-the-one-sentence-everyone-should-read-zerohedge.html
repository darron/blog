      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">A key reason why a preponderance of the population is fascinated with the student loan market is that as USA Today reported in a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/college/2010-09-10-student-loan-debt_N.htm">landmark piece</a> last year, it is now bigger than ever the credit card market. And as the monthly consumer debt update from the Fed reminds us, the primary source of funding is none other than the US government. To many, this market has become <strong>the </strong>biggest credit bubble in America. Why do we make a big deal out of this? Because as Bloomberg reported last night, we now have prima facie evidence that the student loan market is not only an epic bubble, but it is also the next subprime!</blockquote>
