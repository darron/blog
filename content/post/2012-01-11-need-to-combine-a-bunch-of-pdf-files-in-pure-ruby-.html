<p>Found a great set of gems:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/paulschreiber/pdf-merger">PDF Merger</a>&nbsp;(also requires<span style=""> </span><a href="http://rjb.rubyforge.org/">RJB</a>, and <a href="http://itextpdf.com/download.php">iText</a>)</p>
<p>Once you've got your JRE installed and iText installed - install the gems:</p>
<p>gem install pdf-merger<br /> gem install rjb</p>
<p>Then this code is as simple as it gets:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1596012.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>
<p>That's it - works well on OS X - haven't tried it elsewhere yet.</p>
