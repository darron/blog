      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">Reuters <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE75T0GD20110630?irpc=932">reports</a> that the Obama administration has established a policy of formal contacts with the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
<p>
	The Brotherhood is the world’s most important Islamist organization. It is openly, unabashedly committed to the destruction of the United States and the West. In typical Obama fashion, this disastrous decision to engage America’s avowed enemies has been couched as the mere continuation of prior policy: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is reported to have confirmed that the U.S. would “resume” contacts which had “occurred in recent years.” But make no mistake about it, this is a new policy. </p>
<p>
	The contacts that have occurred in recent years have been outside of U.S. policy — at the urging of leftists in the State Department, the intelligence community, the commentariat, and, in particular, the Obama White House. They have long campaigned for a policy of “engagement” with the Muslim Brotherhood (including Hamas, the terrorist organization <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/258381/hamas-muslim-brotherhood-andrew-c-mccarthy">that is the Brotherhood’s Palestinian branch</a>). They’ve needed to do this campaigning because it was American policy <em>not</em> to deal with the Brotherhood — dealing with the Brothers empowers them, bolstering their status as leaders of mainstream Islam and legitimizing their agenda, which calls for Islamicizing societies, ultimately establishing a global caliphate, destroying Israel, and incrementally expanding sharia throughout the West.</p></blockquote>
