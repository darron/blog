<p>I read somewhere online that part of King Tut's curse meant that you had to wear a pink tutu for the rest of your life. This is supported by many scholars and is documented extensively in the archaeological literature.</p>

<p>PS - explaining to your kids that not everything that's online is true is hard.</p>
