      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Mahmoud al-Mabhouh took no notice of the two men who joined him in the lift of
his hotel in Dubai during the short ride to the second floor on the
afternoon of January 20.
</p>
<p>
One was short and portly with a moustache, the other tall. Dressed in sports
gear and carrying tennis rackets, they looked like any other European
tourists visiting the Gulf state for some winter sun.
</p>
<p>
He did not realise that the two men were part of an 11-strong team that had
come to kill him. In just over five hours he would be dead.</p></blockquote>
