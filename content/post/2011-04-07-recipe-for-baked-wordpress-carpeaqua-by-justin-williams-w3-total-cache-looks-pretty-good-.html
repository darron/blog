      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><a href="http://inessential.com/2011/04/04/more_again_again_on_the_static_weblogs_t">Brent Simmons</a> is still frustrated because so many sites <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> links to are inaccessible because of the massive amount of traffic it brings.
