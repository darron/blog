<p>I'm trying to find a decent Canadian VPS provider that I can use for some of my customers.</p>
<p>Yes - I know that having your data in Canada is not really any safer than having it hosted in the USA, but I can't fully convince some of my client's legal departments.</p>
<p>I need:</p>
<p>1. The ability to start up additional instances without calling somebody or filling out a form so that they will "get back to me". Ideally there would be an <a href="http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/overview.html">api</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/mobile/">iPhone app</a> or <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/">web interface</a> where I can do just that - just like I already do with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>2. Ubuntu LTS is required - CentOS or Windows only need not apply.</p>
<p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-cloud-backup-overview">Onsite backups at reasonable prices</a>. I will take care of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strongspace.com">offsite snapshots</a>&nbsp;- likely in the USA as I can't find reasonable storage costs for 200+GB in Canada.</p>
<p>4. Reliability - I am not interested in the lowest price - I will pay more if the servers are stable.</p>
<p>5. No yearly contracts.</p>
</p>
<p>I want:</p>
<p>1. Ability to scale up those instances dynamically - <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/managing-your-server-6-resizing-your-server">just like I can currently do</a> with Rackspace Cloud.</p>
<p>2. Multiple locations in Canada would be nice.</p>
<p>3. Would be awesome if they worked with <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> or had a <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace">knife</a> <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-ec2">plugin</a> - but not a deal breaker - I can always just <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/knife_bootstrap.html">knife bootstrap</a>&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>4. Pay by the hour resources - but will pay by the month / quarter if needed.</p>
<p>Is this too much to ask?</p>
<p>Anybody know of a company with Canadian server hardware that fits the bill?</p>
