writing: which stories were overblown, what stories were missed entirely, and
what can be gleaned about Iran's <i>annus
horribilis</i> from a more thorough understanding. <i>FP</i> asked seven prominent Iranian-Americans, deeply immersed in both

at what actually happened in Tehran -- and why so many of us got it so wrong.</blockquote>
