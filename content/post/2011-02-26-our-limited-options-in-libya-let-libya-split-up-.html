      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">The <strong><i>Toronto Star</i></strong>’s <a href="http://www.thestar.com/opinion/article/943864--siddiqui-civil-war-may-cause-libya-to-split-in-two" target="_blank">Haroon Siddiqui</a> offers another possible, admittedly imperfect, solution to the Libyan problem. Gadhafi has already lost the eastern half of the country, he reasons, so why not just let the East “peel off” and become its own country. Gadhafi might wage a brutal war to win it back, but Siddiqui thinks it’s more likely he will “let it go to keep what he has,” and the international community could flood the East with aid, effectively salvaging half the country while waiting for Gadhafi to die.</blockquote>
