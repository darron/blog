      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">You might feel at times that you are ugly and disgusting and unlovable.&nbsp;Some of you might feel as though you are beautiful and hot and cool and awesome.&nbsp;Know this: When you’re in your 20s you go through, like, a time machine of opposite days.&nbsp;What I mean is, everyone who thinks they are hot shit in high school eventually turns into cold diarrhea by their 30s.&nbsp;And all you ugly nerds will eventually start to sparkle like geodes.&nbsp;If you don’t believe me you can ask Facebook.</blockquote>
