      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">The left wing Israeli newspaper <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/egypt-protesters-and-soldiers-the-army-and-the-people-are-one-1.339985" target="_blank">Haaretz</a> says that Egyptian army officers in Cairo’s central square have tossed aside their helmets and joined the crowd. “The Army and the people are one,” they chanted. <a href="http://photoblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/01/29/5946910-demonstrators-in-egypt-pose-on-burned-vehicles-and-atop-army-tanks-in-cairo" target="_blank">MSNBC’s photoblog</a> shows protesters jubilantly perched on M1A1 tanks. The real significance of these defections is that the army officers would not have done so had they not sensed which way the winds were blowing — in the Egyptian officer corps.</blockquote>
