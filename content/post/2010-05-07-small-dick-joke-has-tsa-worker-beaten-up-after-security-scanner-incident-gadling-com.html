<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">During a training session at Miami International Airport, a TSA supervisor joked about the size of the manhood of one of his colleagues who had just stepped into the machine. The supervisor was operating the equipment when he made the remark - so his joke could have been based on facts.
<p>Rolando Negrin couldn't appreciate the jokes about his genitalia, so at the end of his shift, he used a police baton to beat up the supervisor in an airport parking garage. The police report states "victim stated he was in fear and complied with [Negron]." after being told to get down on his knees and apologize.</p>
