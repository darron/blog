      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There's a lot of talk about how to deal with incidents like the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Newtown Connecticut, and one being floated by conservatives is the idea of arming school teachers and administrators.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; That's not a far out idea.&nbsp; The Harrold ISD in North Texas has allowed teachers to carry guns in the classroom since 2008, according to principal David Thweatt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; "If you are unarmed, these people are going into those areas where they know people will not be able to resist," Thweatt told 1200 WOAI news.</span></p></blockquote>
