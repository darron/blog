      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Retired teacher Jo Danielson is living on the edge with an abdominal aneurysm, a dangerous bulge in her aorta, the largest single artery in the body.</p><p>But because Danielson, 73, also has heart disease and diabetes, doctors have told her she wouldn't withstand the major abdominal surgery needed to expose the aorta and fix it.</p><p>Instead, doctors have recommended for a less invasive, endovascular aneurysm repair, in which a device called a "stent" is inserted into the diseased aorta through a big artery in the groin.</p><p>But she will have to wait until April, when the Vancouver Island Health Authority's next budget year begins. The health authority has placed a cost-saving, yearly cap on the stent procedure because of the extra cost.</p><p>So Danielson said she does her best to live quietly, keep the stress down and wait. "I've got a time bomb and it's waiting to go off."</p></blockquote>
