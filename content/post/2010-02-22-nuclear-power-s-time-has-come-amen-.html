      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>One of the things I learned is that we've already been burying nuclear waste in New Mexico at the waste isolation pilot plant for 10 years now. Works fine. It's a salt formation 3,000 foot thick -- you go half a mile down and that salt formation has been there for 250 million years. It's not going anywhere. ... It's a perfectly good place to stash this stuff if you want to get rid of it.</p> <p>Environmentalists will say there's no working nuclear repository anywhere in the world and you look and actually there's one being built in Finland.</p></blockquote>
