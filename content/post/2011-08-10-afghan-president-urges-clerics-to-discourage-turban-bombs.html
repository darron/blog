In both cases, the bombers grabbed their victims before triggering the explosives.</p><p></p><p>It is believed to be the first time turbans have been used in suicide attacks.</p><p></p><p>A man’s turban has important religious and cultural significance and it is considered dishonourable to touch it. </p><p></p><p>Karzai met with clerics this week and pleaded with them to use their influence on the Taliban and other insurgents to dissuade them from using cultural or religious garments to hide explosives.</p><p></p><p>In the past, insurgents have also used burqas to hide explosives because male guards normally will not search a woman.</p></blockquote>
