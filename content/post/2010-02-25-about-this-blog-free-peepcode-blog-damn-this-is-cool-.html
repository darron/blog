      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Many developments in computer science have nothing to do with
          the capabilities of computers, but with the way we use them.</p>
          <p>A few years ago, an article on Airbag Industries<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://blog.peepcode.com/tutorials/2010/about-this-blog#fn1">1</a></sup> inspired me to
          think about writing a blog with a unique design per post.</p>
          <p>There are many benefits:</p>
          <ul>
          	<li>It encourages creativity both at the computer and away from it</li>
          	<li>It’s like a code kata for design</li>
          	<li>You can easily experiment with cutting-edge CSS3 features or just learn CSS2</li>
          	<li>You’ll learn how to build a style foundation for other designs in other applications</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On the downside, it takes more time than simply writing prose.</p></blockquote>

    <p>This is great - totally understand about the homogenization of website content. I struggle with this all of the time with our sites and our client sites - it simply takes time (and costs more money) to make custom pages each time.</p><p>This is an inspiration on how to do it properly.</p></div>
