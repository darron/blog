      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>As US secretary of state, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/colin-powell" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Colin Powell">Colin Powell</a> gathered his notes in front of the United Nations security council, the man watching — Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, known to the west's intelligence services as "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/curveball" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Curveball">Curveball</a>" — had more than an inkling of what was to come. He was, after all, Powell's main source, a man his German handlers had feted as a new "Deep throat" — an agent so pivotal that he could bring down a government.</p><p>As Curveball watched <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/feb/05/iraq.usa?INTCMP=SRCH" title="">Powell make the US case to invade Iraq</a>, he was hiding an admission that he has not made until now: that nearly every word he had told his interrogators from Germany's secret service, the BND, was a lie.</p></blockquote>
