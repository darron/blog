    <p>If you cannot capture somebody OR try them and keep them off the street/battlefield - the net result during warfare is that they get killed.</p><p>Which option allows you to correct mistakes? Bush's. (You can't correct it when they've been vaporized.)</p><p>Which option follows more of the rule of law? Bush's. (Detention with eventual trial is WAY better than BOOM. Even with all of the procedural issues around Guantanamo - you can't say that Predator drone strikes are more lawful.)</p><p>Don't get me wrong, there are people that simply need to be killed - but you can't say that Obama's drone superhighway is the better, more lawful, more human option.</p></div>
