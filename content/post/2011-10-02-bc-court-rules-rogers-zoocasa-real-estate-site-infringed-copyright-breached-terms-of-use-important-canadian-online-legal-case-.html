      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">The <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2011/2011bcsc1196/2011bcsc1196.html">decision</a>
includes many important findings on online contracts, trespass, and
copyright. The court canvasses the law of online contracts and
concludes that website terms of use can be enforceable.&nbsp; In this
particular case, Century 21's terms prohibited copying or scraping its
content. By doing so, Zoocasa breached the contract. The court awarded
$1,000 in damages for the breach. Note that the court even finds that
continuing to link to the Century 21 site (a practice prohibited by
Century 21 once it provides notice) was a breach of the contract.</blockquote>
