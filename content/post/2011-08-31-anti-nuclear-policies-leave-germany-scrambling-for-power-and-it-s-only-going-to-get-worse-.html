      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Germany was all in a lather to shut down its nuclear reactors after the disaster at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster" target="_blank">Fukushima</a> panicked the country’s leaders.</p>
<p>What if a similar tsunami and earthquake hit Germany? Nevermind that Germany, unlike Japan, isn’t located on an ocean coastline prone to tsunamis. The point was to make a public show of devotion to alternatives (even if that might mean coal), and please Euro envirozealots.<span></span></p>
<p>So Berlin declared that it would shut down eight of its 17 reactors immediately, and the rest within a decade or so. Great celebration. Hurray for the far-seeing legislators and their deep appreciation&nbsp; of environmental concerns.</p>
<p>Except now Europe’s economic powerhouse is worried about brownouts, and is busily importing energy from countries with working rectors and pollution-spewing coal plants.</p></blockquote>
