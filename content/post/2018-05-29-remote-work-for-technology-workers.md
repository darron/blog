At the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/IDIOT-Meetup-Infrastructure-Dev-Integrations-Ops-Teams/events/250348023/">YYC IDIOT Meetup last week</a>, I got to talk about my perspective on remote work.

I got to talk about:

1. What's good about remote work.
2. What's not good about remote work.
3. How I got my first remote job.
4. Some tips about how you may be able to get a remote job based on that experience.

Here's the slides with the audio recording from the event:

I've posted the [slides on Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/darron/remote-work-for-technology-workers).

Please note: This is not an official Salesforce Presentation. It is also not official Salesforce policy. These are my opinions based on my experience.
