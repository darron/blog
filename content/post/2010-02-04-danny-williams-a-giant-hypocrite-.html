      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">To support his attack, Williams referred to a briefing note containing quotes from Harper's writings before he became prime minister, including one on health care.<p>

"What we clearly need is experimentation - with market reforms and private delivery options within the public system," Williams attributed to a Harper speech made in Charlottetown.</p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.thewesternstar.com/index.cfm?sid=171094&amp;sc=506">thewesternstar.com</a></div>
    <p>That quote makes me smile.</p><p>He uses the words "private delivery options" as a political smear during elections and then runs out and makes use of them when his own life is at risk.</p><p>Make no mistake: There should be nothing wrong with spending your own money on your health.</p><p>But pompous windbag politicians like Danny Williams have deemed that outcome "un-Canadian" and "against our values."</p><p>Hypocrite.</p></div>
