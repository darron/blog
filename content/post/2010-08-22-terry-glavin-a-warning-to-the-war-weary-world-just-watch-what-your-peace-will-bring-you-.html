      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Killing aid workers is what the Taliban does. It is what the Taliban wants to do. But read <a href="http://ochaonline.un.org/whd/">the four principles</a> Watkins mentions as though they were some sort of pass you could wave under a Talib's nose so he won't chop your head off. It is precisely <span style="font-style: italic;">because</span> these are the principles that govern a humanitarian aid worker's service that the Taliban targets them and kills them. It is precisely <span style="font-style: italic;">because</span> the delivery of humanitarian aid in a place like Afghanistan cannot be "autonomous from the political, economic, military or  other objectives that any actor may hold" that it is delusional to carry on in this way.</blockquote>
