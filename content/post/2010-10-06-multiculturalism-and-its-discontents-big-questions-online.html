      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Here is something I have learned the hard way, but which a lot of well-meaning people in the West have a hard time accepting: <em>All human beings are equal, but all cultures and religions are not. </em>A culture that celebrates femininity and considers women to be the masters of their own lives is better than a culture that mutilates girls’ genitals and confines them behind walls and veils or flogs and stones them for falling in love. . . . The culture of the Western Enlightenment is <em>better. </em>(italics in the original)</blockquote>
