      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">The idea behind the program was that you, the consumer, got to engage with Pepsi by voting for the "Refresh" projects you deemed most worthy. There were also other opportunities to engage through an enormous online effort -- <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pepsi?v=app_172514199440725">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/pepsi">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srY7Wkl2IbI">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.refresheverything.com/">website</a>, <a href="http://www.refresheverything.com/blog/">blogs</a>. Millions of dollars were also spent in what might be called "traditional advertising in support of social media." <p>
