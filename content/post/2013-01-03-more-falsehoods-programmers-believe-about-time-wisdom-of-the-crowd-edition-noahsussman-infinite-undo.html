      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><strong>A great many of the false assumptions listed were my own.</strong>  Especially “time stamps are always in seconds since epoch” and “the duration of a system clock minute is always pretty close to the duration of a wall clock minute.”  Whoa did I ever live to regret my ignorance in those two cases!  But hey, apparently I’m not the only one who has run into (or inadvertently caused) such issues.  A lot of people responded and shared similar experiences.</blockquote>
