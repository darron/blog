      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>But the greatest impact of an increasing-return wave comes long
after the technology is invented. It comes when the technology is
democratized. Gutenberg’s printing press took decades to generate
the Reformation. Today’s container ships go not much faster than a
19th-century steamship, and today’s Internet sends each pulse
little quicker than a 19th-century telegraph—but everybody is using
them, not just the rich. Jets travel at the same speeds they did in
the 1970s, but budget airlines are new.</p>
<p>So what is the flywheel of the perpetual innovation machine that
drives the modern world? Why has innovation become routine? How was
it that, in Alfred North Whitehead’s words, “The greatest invention
of the 19th century was the invention of the method of
invention?”&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
