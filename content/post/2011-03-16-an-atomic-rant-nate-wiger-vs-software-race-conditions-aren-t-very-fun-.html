      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">Bottom line: Any operation that can alter a value&nbsp;<strong>must</strong> return that value in the&nbsp;<em>same operation</em> for it to be atomic. If you do a separate get then set, or set then get, you’re open to a race condition. There are very few systems that support an “increment and return” type operation, and Redis is one of them (Oracle sequences are another).</blockquote>
