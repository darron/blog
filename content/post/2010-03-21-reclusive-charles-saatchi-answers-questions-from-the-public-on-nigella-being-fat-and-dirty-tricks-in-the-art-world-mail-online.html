      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Do you believe in market research? </p><p>I have spent too long being able to manipulate the answers I want from market research to rely upon its findings any more than I do weather forecasts. Many of the great success stories in marketing only came about because someone at the top of an organisation wanted to ignore the research and follow his own prejudices - on the basis that all his competitors would be carrying out the same research, receive back the same conclusions, follow them slavishly --and he would therefore be left with a unique proposition for his own product, which he in any event believed in. </p></blockquote>
