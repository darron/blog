<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>So, what is GitHub Flow?</p>

<ul>
<li>Anything in the <code>master</code> branch is deployable</li>

<li>To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of <code>master</code> (ie: <code>new-oauth2-scopes</code>)</li>

<li>Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server</li>

<li>When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">pull request</a></li>

<li>After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master</li>

<li>Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and <em>should</em> deploy immediately</li></ul></blockquote>
