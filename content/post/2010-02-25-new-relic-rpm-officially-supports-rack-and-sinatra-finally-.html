<div class="posterous_bookmarklet_entry">
      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><a href="http://www.newrelic.com/">New Relic's RPM</a>, an application performance monitoring and reporting system, has today announced it has added full support for Sinatra and Rack-based Ruby applications to its traditionally Rails-centric service. It's been possible to hack in support for non-Rails apps into New Relic before, but this move brings them officially into the fold with all of the features only Rails apps used to be able to take advantage of.</blockquote>
