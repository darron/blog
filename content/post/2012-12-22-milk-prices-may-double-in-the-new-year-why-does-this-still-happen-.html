      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>It works like this: In order to keep <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/11/27/news/economy/farming/index.html?iid=EL">dairy farmers</a> in businesses, the government agrees to buy milk and other products if the price gets too low. The current <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/04/news/economy/farm-subsidies/index.html?iid=EL">agriculture bill</a> has a formula that  means the government steps in if the price of milk were to drop by roughly half from its current national average of about $3.65 a gallon.
                       
                   </p>

                        Problem is, the current bill expired last summer, and Congress had been unable to agree on a new one. Several protections for farmers have already expired, and several more are set to do so over the next few months. One of them is the dairy subsidy, which expires January 1.

                        But instead of leaving farmers entirely out in the cold, the law states that if a new bill isn't passed or the current one extended, the formula for calculating the price the government pays for dairy products reverts back to a 1949 statute. Under that formula, the government would be forced to buy milk at twice today's price -- driving up the cost for everyone.</p></blockquote>
