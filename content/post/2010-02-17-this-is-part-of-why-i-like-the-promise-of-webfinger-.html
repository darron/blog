      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">To Chris, the @reply would "just work" regardless of what network I was on.  Assuming the other party supported the above protocols, this could have worked to <a href="http://identi.ca" class="ot-anchor">identi.ca</a>, <a href="http://cliqset.com" class="ot-anchor">cliqset.com</a>, <a href="http://friendfeed.com" class="ot-anchor">friendfeed.com</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com" class="ot-anchor">twitter.com</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com" class="ot-anchor">facebook.com</a>, etc.  And the protocols themselves are easy, likely only a simple extension of endpoints these networks are already exposing.  And not only is this process fully decentralized (i.e., there doesn't need to be a Google in the middle), it delegates very well, so that domain owners wouldn't have to implement it themselves -- but they could later if they wanted to.</blockquote>
