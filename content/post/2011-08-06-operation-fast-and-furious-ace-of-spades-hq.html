      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>The smartest administration in the history of the world conceived of this plan.</p>

<p>The plan was to just let thousands of weapons flow to murderous drug cartels.</p>

<p>And then take those cartels down.</p>

<p>But they didn't take the cartels down, because they didn't track the guns.</p>

<p>They instead were to follow the money, but they also didn't do that.</p>

<p>A US border agent was killed due to the illegal arms sent to a neighboring sovereign country in this massive covert operation.</p>

<p>In addition, so was the brother of a Mexican attorney general.</p>

<p>So were a number of other Mexican citizens murdered with these weapons -- we don't know the number yet.</p>

<p>In conducting this massive covert action, we lied to officials in this neighboring sovereign country, even though their people (and cops, and officials) were getting killed with our weapons.</p>

<p>As far as I know, we haven't taken any action beyond arresting a few straw buyers... who could have easily been arrested, <i>with the weapons</i>, when they attempted to smuggled them or sell them.</p>

<p>We have not taken down any cartels at all.</p>

<p>In fact, we've not done anything except <i>murdered people</i> by indirect, but perfectly foreseeable, US covert action.</p></blockquote>
