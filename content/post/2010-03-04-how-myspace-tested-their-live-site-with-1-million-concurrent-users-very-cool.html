      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #123185; font-size: small;">For MySpace, the  goal was to test an additional 1 million concurrent users on their live  site stressing the new video features.&nbsp; The key word here is ‘concurrent’.&nbsp;  Not over the course of an hour or day… 1 million users concurrently  active on the site. It should be noted that 1 million virtual users  are only a portion of what MySpace typically has on the site during  its peaks.&nbsp; They wanted to supplement the live traffic with test  traffic to get an idea of the overall performance impact of the new  launch on the entire infrastructure.&nbsp; This requires a massive amount  of load generation capability, which is where cloud computing comes  into play. To do this testing, MySpace worked with SOASTA to use the  cloud as a load generation platform.</span>&nbsp;</blockquote>
