      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">The Google Visualization API lets you access multiple sources of structured data
  that you can display, choosing from a large selection of visualizations. Google
  Visualization API enables you to expose your own data, stored on any data-store
  that is connected to the web, as a Visualization compliant datasource. Thus you
  can create reports and dashboards as well as analyze and display your data through
  the wealth of available visualization applications. The Google Visualization API
  also provides a platform that can be used to create, share and reuse visualizations
  written by the developer community at large.</blockquote>
