      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>The global cooling caused by these high carbon clouds wouldn't be as catastrophic as a superpower-versus-superpower nuclear winter, but "the effects would still be regarded as leading to unprecedented climate change," research physical scientist <a href="http://acdb-ext.gsfc.nasa.gov/People/Oman/">Luke Oman</a> said during a press briefing Friday at a <a href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/">meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Earth is currently in a <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/12/091208-copenhagen-climate-conference-global-warming-climategate.html">long-term warming trend</a>. After a regional nuclear war, though, average global temperatures would drop by 2.25 degrees F (1.25 degrees C) for two to three years afterward, the models suggest.</p><p>At the extreme, the tropics, Europe, Asia, and Alaska would cool by 5.4 to 7.2 degrees F (3 to 4 degrees C), according to the models. Parts of the Arctic and Antarctic would actually warm a bit, due to shifted wind and ocean-circulation patterns, the researchers said.</p></blockquote>
